This script redefines the % motion so that (in addition to its usual behavior)
it cycles through if/elif/else, try/except/catch, for/continue/break, and
while/continue/break structures.  The script also
defines g% to cycle in the opposite direction.  Two other motions, [% and ]%,
go to the start and end of the current block, respectively.

All of these motions should work in Normal, Visual, and Operator-pending
modes.  For example, d]% should delete (characterwise) until the end of the
current block; v]%d should do the same, going through Visual mode so that
you can see what is being deleted; and V]%d makes it linewise.
