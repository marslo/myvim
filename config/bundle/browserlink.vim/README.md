# Looking for a new owner

This plugin was much fun to build but it clearly needs more love than I am able to devote right now. If someone would like to take ownership of the project, email me or file a bug.

# Browserlink.vim
Browserlink is a live browser editing plugin for Vim.

## Live edit CSS

Browserlink allows you to live edit CSS files, which are sent to the browser on change, without reloading or changing the state of the page.

## Live evaluate JavaScript

Browserlink allows you to evaluate buffers or selections of JavaScript directly, or even call individual functions within the buffer, for instant feedback in the browser.

## New: Keep in sync with Chrome Inspector

The Chrome inspector allows you to set source maps from network resources to the local filesystem. In the latest version of Browserlink, you can set

```
window.__BL_OVERRIDE_CACHE = true
```

to disable the cache breaker. After setting up Chrome as desired, enable `:set autoread` and you'll get results like this:

## How it works
Browserlink is very simple. The plugin itself hooks autocommands for file changes (and other things) to the provided functions. The functions connect through HTTP to a node.js backend, which your webpage connects also to. The entire process happens extremely fast.

## Installation and Setup
To install, either download the repo, or as I would recommend, use [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

```
git clone git://github.com/jaxbot/browserlink.vim.git
```

If you haven't already, you'll need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (Node is used to send refresh commands to your page(s))

Lastly, you need some javascript on your page(s) to listen for the refresh commands.  For this there are two options:

1. Add this script to your page(s)

```
<script src='http://127.0.0.1:9001/js/socket.js'></script>
```

2. **OR** Use a GreaseMonkey script to inject the javascript into your project:

Userscript injection extensions/solutions:
* [Chromium's built in support](http://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/user-scripts)
* [TamperMonkey Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
* [Greasemonkey Firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/)

Userscript template (update the [@match rule](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/match_patterns) to the url of your local project):
```
// ==UserScript==
// @name       Browserlink Embed
// @namespace  http://use.i.E.your.homepage/
// @version    0.1
// @description  enter something useful
// @match      http://localhost/*
// @copyright  2012+, You
// ==/UserScript==

var src = document.createElement("script");
src.src = "http://127.0.0.1:9001/js/socket.js";
src.async = true;
document.head.appendChild(src);
```

I prefer the GreaseMonkey/Userscript method, as it's more universal and I don't have extra development junk in my projects. But it's totally up to you.

## Usage

Once set up, Vim should now call the Node server whenever you save a .html, .js, .php, or .css file. Then just load up your web project like normal, and Vim should send signals over the websocket to reload the pages automatically. Nifty.

In addition:

`:BLReloadPage`

will reload the current pages

`:BLReloadCSS`

will reload the current stylesheets

`:BLEvaluateBuffer`

will evaluate the current buffer

You can also use <leader>be to evaluate selections or buffers, <leader>br to reload, and <leader>bc to reload stylesheets manually.

`:BLConsole`

An experimental feature that will print out `console.log` results from the webpage into a buffer. When in console mode:

* `i` - shortcut to `:BLEval`
* `cc` - clears console buffer
* `r` - refreshes console buffer
* `<CR>` - attempts to load the highlighted trace line

If you want to disable the overriding of `console.log` on your page, set:

```
window.__BL_NO_CONSOLE_OVERRIDE = true
```

`:BLErrors`

Load accumulated Javascript errors of the current session into the quickfix list

`:BLClearErrors`

Reset the error list.

If you want to get super efficient, you can hook an autocmd to when you leave insert mode (or other times) to reload, say, the stylesheets:

`au InsertLeave *.css :BLReloadCSS`

This function can be easily tweaked to fit your needs/workflow, and I highly recommend you do so to maximize your utility from this plugin.

## Options

`g:bl_no_autoupdate`

If set, Browserlink won't try to reload pages/CSS when you save respective files.

`g:bl_no_eager`

If set, Browserlink won't autostart the server when a command is run and the server does not respond.

`g:bl_no_mappings`

If set, Browserlink won't map be, br, and bc commands.

`g:bl_serverpath`

Set if your server is not hosted on 127.0.0.1:9001. You will also need to change the socket.js file.

`g:bl_urlpaths`

A dictionary defining mappings from URLs to filesystem paths. Set this if you want to use the
quickfix list for pages not accessed via a file://-URL.

`g:bl_pagefiletypes`

A list of filetype strings that should trigger automatic page reloads on write.
Defaults to `['html', 'javascript', 'php']`.

## Notes

This is an experimental project, but it works really well for me, and I hope you enjoy it! I kept the source as simple as possible, and it's pretty easy to edit to your needs. I'm open to any suggestions, too, so let me know.

## Shameless plug

I hack around with Vim plugins, so [follow me](https://github.com/jaxbot) if you're into that kind of stuff (or just want to make my day) ;)
