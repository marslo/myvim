There is a major rework for Vim7 underway. In case you are missing any features, this is the time to suggest them. Send me an email or report your bugs or suggestions in the trac at the link above. This is a serious request from me to the users. In the past a lof of people complained on mailing lists, that "this doesn't work" or "that feature is missing", without contacting me. If you don't tell the upstream author, then this won't change!

Stay tuned.
