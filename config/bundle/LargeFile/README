Editing large files can be a time consuming process as Vim is working on a number of things behind the scenes, such as maintaining an undo database, searching for a syntax highlighting synchronization point, etc.  LargeFile.vim is a very small "plugin"; mostly, its just an autocmd that disables certain features of vim in the interests of speed.

There's an option:  g:LargeFile (by default, its 100).  It describes the minimum size of a file needed for it to be considered as a "LargeFile", in megabytes.  You may set that option in your <.vimrc>.

The plugin is based on vimtip#611.
