1. Increasing/Decreasing Lists		*visincr*
					*visincr-increase* *visincr-decrease*
					*visincr-increment* *visincr-decrement*

The visincr plugin facilitates making a column of increasing or decreasing
numbers, dates, or daynames.

					*I* *viscinr-I* *RI*
	:I [#]  Will use the first line's number as a starting point to build
	        a column of increasing numbers (or decreasing numbers if the
		increment is negative).

		    Default increment: 1
		    Justification    : left (will pad on the right)

		Restricted version (:RI) applies number incrementing only to
		those lines in the visual block that begin with a number.

					*II* *visincr-II* *RII*
	:II [# [zfill]]  Will use the first line's number as a starting point
		to build a column of increasing numbers (or decreasing numbers
		if the increment is negative).

		    Default increment: 1
		    Justification    : right (will pad on the left)
		    Zfill            : left padding will be done with the given
		                       character, typically a zero.

		Restricted version (:RII) applies number incrementing only to
		those lines in the visual block that begin with zero or more
		spaces and end with a number.

	:IYMD [#]    year/month/day	*IYMD*	*visincr-IYMD* *RIYMD*
	:IMDY [#]    month/day/year	*IMDY*	*visincr-IMDY* *RIMDY*
	:IDMY [#]    day/month/year	*IDMY*	*visincr-IDMY* *IDMY*
		Will use the starting line's date to construct an increasing
		or decreasing list of dates, depending on the sign of the
		number.

		    Default increment: 1 (in days)

		Restricted version (:RIYMD, :RIMDY, :RIDMY) applies number
		incrementing only to those lines in the visual block that
		begin with a date (#/#/#).

					*ID* *visincr-ID* *RID*
	:ID [#]	Will produce an increasing/decreasing list of daynames.  Three-letter
	        daynames will be used if the first day on the first line is a three
		letter dayname; otherwise, full names will be used.

		Restricted version (:RID) applies number incrementing only
		to those lines in the visual block that begin with a dayname
		(mon tue wed thu fri sat).

	:IM [#] will produce an increasing/decreasing list of monthnames.  Monthnames
		may be three-letter versions (jan feb etc) or fully-spelled out
		monthnames.

		Restricted version (:RIM) applies number incrementing only
		to those lines in the visual block that begin with a
		monthname (jan feb mar etc).


	For :I and :II:
		If the visual block is ragged on the right-hand side (as can
		easily happen when the "$" is used to select the
		right-hand-side), the block will have spaces appended to
		straighten it out.  If the string length of the count exceeds
		the visual-block, then additional spaces will be inserted as
		needed.  Leading tabs are handled by using virtual column
		calculations.

	For :IYMD, :IMDY, and IDMY:
		You'll need the <calutil.vim> plugin, available as
		"Calendar Utilities" under the following url:
