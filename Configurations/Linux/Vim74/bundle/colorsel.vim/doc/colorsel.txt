DESCRIPTION						*colorsel-description*

A simple interactive RGB/HSV color selector modelled after the Gimp2 RGB/HSV
color selector. Needs gvim 7 or higher and :set nocp (and probably a high-
color display).

==============================================================================
USAGE							      *colorsel-usage*

:ColorSel [{rrbbgg}|{color-name} [{rrbbgg}|{color-name}]]

The command accepts one or two optional {rrggbb} or {color-name} arguments.
The second one will become the reference (alternate) or foreground/background
color that is not currently being edited if specified. One can also keep an
existing color by passing '.', '-' or '*' in its place, so for example use >
    :ColorSel . White
to set the foreground color to white.

:ColorSel [guifg={color-name}] [guibg={color-name}]

When editing a Vim highlighting or colorscheme, you can directly pass the
(previously yanked) |guifg| and |guibg| |highlight-gui| arguments. 

:ColorSel {hlgroup-name}

The "guifg" and "guibg" attributes of the existing Vim highlight group
{hlgroup-name} will be used to initialize the foreground/background color
selection. Editing will start with the foreground color if the highlight group
has no "guibg" attribute. Use the "X" key to toggle between editing the
foreground and background color, and "f" to change the "gui" attribute (bold
and italic attributes are supported). Any changes are applied "live" to the
highlight group, so you can easily preview your changes if you have another
buffer opened which has the corresponding syntax highlightings. You can still
update the colors via :ColorSel {color-name} commands; the link to the
highlight group will only be broken when you close the color selector window
(e.g. via "q").

KEYS							       *colorsel-keys*

j, k  switch between channels (also: <up>, <down>)
0, $  sets value to zero, maximum (also: <home>, <end>)
h, l  increment/decrement by 1 (also: <left>, <right>)
w, b  increment/decrement by larger amount (also: <pageup>, <pagedown>)
q     quits immediately
y     yanks color in #rrggbb form to the unnamed register
["x]y yanks color in #rrggbb form to register x and shows the color in
      palette entry x
["x]p pastes the color from palette entry x into the color selector (and
      overrides the currently edited color)
["x]Y yanks the alternate color selector (if the swatch has been split via
      'x') or the foreground/background color that is not currently edited
      in #rrggbb form to register x and shows the color in palette entry x
["x]P pastes the color from palette entry x into the alternate color
      selector (if the swatch has been split via 'x') or as the
      foreground/background color that is not currently edited
 x    keeps the current color as a reference in the lower half of the swatch
      and subsequently swaps the current with that alternate color
 X    toggles between editing the foreground text and background swatch color
 /    prompts for a new foreground text shown in the swatch; enter multiple
      lines of text through CTRL-V <Enter>
 f    formats the foreground text shown in the swatch in bold and/or italic,
      or turns it off
